## Overview

*** Please look at the src folder for the code and index on pages folder for example

### The challenge

Users should be able to:

Build a function knightMoves that shows the shortest possible way to get from one square to another by outputting all squares the knight will stop on along the way.


## My process

### Built with

- [React](https://reactjs.org/) - JS library
- [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) - React framework

### What I learned

At first I was stuck on how I was going to make this work. I read an article on GeeksForGeeks that was similar to the project, but it only showed the distance. The project requires distance and path.
The article gave me the idea of how it kind of work, I just had to figure out how to tie it all together and learn what the code was actually doing. I figured the best way to find the knights path
was to pass the previous knight path on the current knight like the linkedList node that I worked on previously. 

### Continued development

I would like to keep doing projects like this so I am able to recreate this without having to look at videos.

### Useful resources

- [Geeks for geeks: minimum steps reach target knight](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/minimum-steps-reach-target-knight/#) - This allowed me to get the idea of how the project would work. This article only shows the distance, not the path.
